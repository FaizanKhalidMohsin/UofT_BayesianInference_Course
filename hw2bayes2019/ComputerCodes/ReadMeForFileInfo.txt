Hello Class,

Here is a description of the files for this week.

The first set of files discusses a worked example:

AnovaExample.pdf: This contains a worked example using OpenBugs. The narration uses OpenBugs in "interactive mode".  The interactive commands can be ignored and one can follow the model structure and the output one can obtain.

DiamondR2OpenBugs.txt: this program contains an example of how to process the worked example by running OpenBugs through R.

DiamondR2All.txt: contains the files that one would use to use OpenBugs interatively.  Most people will probably not use this file.

diamondDat.csv: Contains the data as a "comma separated variable" file.  It is a common way to import data into R.




The next set of files look at some more general issues about some more general issues of common models.

Lect5Modeling.pdf: This is the main file containing the information.

RsimProgY2015.txt and RsimProgY2015Plotter.txt: these two files look at some programs which compare different priors for the precision parameter.  The results are discussed in Lect5Modeling.pdf.
