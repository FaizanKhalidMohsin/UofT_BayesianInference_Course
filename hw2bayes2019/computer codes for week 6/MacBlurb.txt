To all Mac users:

For everyone who uses a Mac, could you please tell me if you have or have not been successful installing Jags or Openbugs.  Also, if you have been successful running either of these programs throught R.

For those who have been successful, would it possible to send me the link to whatever website you found helpful.

For those who have not been successful, after my signiture are some links that I found.  I don't have a Mac,so I don't know if any of those work.  I also realize that you might have already tried these links.  I don't mean to disrespect your intelligence.  I'm just trying to solve a problem.

Thank you,

Mike
